   <h1>Is renewable energy the solution of decarbonizing? 
    Outlook in renewable potential and performance </h1>

        <h2>Aim</h2>

        <p>Climate change is a formidable environmental concern, which leads to natural calamities and biodiversity loss, bringing famine, health risks and poverty to human-being, whose chief culprit is carbon emission. Fossil fuels are the largest contributor to carbon emission, which accounts for over 90% of CO2 
            <ul1><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy">(The UN, n.d.)</a></ul1>. Therefore, renewable energy, which is sustainable, clean and reliable is the key to the solution. 
            This project aims to provide an outlook on the potential and performance of renewable energy by using interactive graphs.
             </p>
        
        <div class="chart3" id="Chart23"></div>
        <P>  darker colours denote greater emission. 
            Data was accessed via the World Bank<ul1><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f6pQOY182L0fvRmmLTSQ_y2s4L0Zkyb8#scrollTo=uL_RuGTliKzo">(Colab Notes)</a></ul1>. 
            The country names do not match the Geojson file. 
            I manually changed the “United States” to “United States of America”, and “Russian Federation “to Russia, and then I deleted some entities which are not countries such as “OECD countries”.  </P>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart24"></div>
        <P>This bubble chart shows three dimensions of data downloaded from <ul1><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC">the World Bank</a></ul1> in a CSV file. I used the linear scale, but the bubbles were stacked on the y-axis, which is hard to observe.
             Then, I used the log scales which are easy to plot data that vary over multiple orders of magnitude. 
             The big green bubble shows the world's average level. Notably, many developed countries are in the lower right area, indicating a high GDP per capita and low carbon intensity.
            Most low-income developing countries are in the lower left area, indicating a low GDP per capita and low carbon intensity.
             Most rich developing countries are in the middle, which implies a moderate GDP per capita and high carbon intensity. 
             Thus, helping rich developing countries to reduce emissions is important for reducing total emissions.
             
        </P>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart25"></div>
        <p>
            The graph shows that the higher the share of renewable energy consumption of total energy consumption, the lower the carbon emission. 
                Thus, renewable energy is the key to reducing emissions. For the data, I choose the world bank as the source since it has two indicators that meet my expectation and they have the same observations, which is suit for running the regression. 
                Massive data sets are accessed via The World Bank API which is convenient and precise <ul1><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aAWEqw06khk1pInCxPLT-A5PE6zuHMmJ#scrollTo=emdbwQZGqQWE">(Colab Notes 1)</a></ul1>

                <h2>Potential & Performance</h2>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart26"></div>
        <p> This graph demonstrates that fossil fuel is dominant in electricity production, but the percentage of electricity production by renewable energy increased from 2000. 
            Among different renewable energy, hydropower is the main source. 
            Moreover, wind energy and solar energy are faster growing, which has great potential. 
            For data, it is from <ul1><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-elec-by-source">Our World in Data</a></ul1> downloaded in a CSV file. 
            The data set is massive across different countries and times, so it is hard to select manually. 
            I used Python to clean the data and then downloaded it as a CSV file
            <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CJFI6wqw7Ib77HSPWcdVQF63rcytWNZz">(Colab Notes).</a></ul1>.

        </p>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart27"></div>
       <p>The key to energy transition is the price of the energy, lower renewable costs make them more competitive compared to fossil energy. 
        The line chart shows the overall decrease in the cost of renewable energy. 
        Moreover, renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, and fossil fuels do not, so renewable energy may be much cheaper than fossil fuels in the future <ul1><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth">(Roser, 2020)</a></ul1>. 
        Data from <ul1><a href="https://www.irena.org/Data/View-data-by-topic/Costs/Global-Trends">the IRENA</a></ul1>  was downloaded by a CSV file.
          
          

</p>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart28"></div>
<p>The driver in the price change in renewable energy is technology (Roser, 2020) The number of patents filed by solar technologies has the largest share, which has great potential.
     Data was downloaded from the <ul1><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/patents-filed-for-renewables">Our World in Data</a></ul1> in CSV file and was cleaned by Python
     <ul1><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xpRrmFLO5lPRt6fW7KKnW3QpFbmkUjp7#scrollTo=YygOY6m0T7b9">(Colab Notes)</a></ul1>.
    </p>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart29"></div>
<p>The graph shows that investment in renewable energy increased from 2004 to 2018. 
    solar technology and wind technology have a large share of investment which is consistent with the good performance of cost decline in renewable energy. 
    Data is from the 
    <ul1><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/investment-in-renewable-energy-by-technology">Our World in Data</a></ul1></p>

        <div class="chart" id="Chart30"></div>
<p>Every dollar of investment in renewable energy generates three times more jobs than in the fossil fuel industry (The UN, 2022).
     In this graph, many jobs are created by renewable technology. 
     Solar technology creates a third of the jobs of the total renewable technology, proving its potential again.
      It can be argued that renewable energy stimulates employment, bringing economic benefits. Data from the <ul1><a href="https://www.irena.org/Data/View-data-by-topic/Benefits/Employment-Time-Series">IRENA</a></ul1>  was downloaded in a CSV file.
      </p>

    
     <div class="myWeek">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>   
    <p>Renewable energy is taking an increasing proportion of the energy structure, and its cost has decreased over the past 10 years which implies that it has a stronger competitive compared to fossil energy.
         The increasing number of patents filed by renewable energy shows the progress of technology. 
         Moreover, the investment also continuously increases. These indicators also have internal connections. 
         Among renewable energy, solar energy and wind energy have the most outstanding performance. 
         Finally, low cost, economic benefit and technological progress make renewable energy affordable, sustainable and safe. 
         This provides motivation to the countries to reduce carbon emissions since they can still develop their economies in a sustainable way.
